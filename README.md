This repository contains code for the Gaussian Process-based Deep State-Space Model (GP-DSSM) proposed in the paper:

Yuhao Liu, Marzieh Ajirak, and Petar M. DjuriÄ‡. "Sequential estimation of Gaussian process-based deep state-space models." IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (2023).

The work is [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10216326](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10216326) or in arXiv [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12528](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12528).
