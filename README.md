This repository contains code for the Gaussian Process-based Deep State-Space Model (GP-DSSM) proposed in the paper:

Yuhao Liu, Marzieh Ajirak, and Petar M. DjuriÄ‡. "Sequential estimation of Gaussian process-based deep state-space models." IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (2023).

09/13/2024 - Added several toy examples.

The case 1 and 2 shows a toy example with one-hidden-layer, where the diagram is as follows:

The case 3 shows a one-hidden-layer example with control input, where the diagram is as follows:

The case 4 shows a one-hidden-layer example with feed-forward control input, where the diagram is as follows:

There are other cases not implemented in the notebook but are easy to construct. Users can customize their models in `models.py`.

1. We can construct a multiple-hidden-layer SSM where the hidden-layer also has transitions:

2. We can construct a multiple-hidden-layer SSM where the hidden-layer does not have transitions:

3. We can construct a multiple-hidden-layer SSM without feed-forward input:
